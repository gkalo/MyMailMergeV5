Connection:
    db: "Oracle" #must be equal to "MySQL" or "Oracle". If not present Oracle is assumed.

#Queries info. A list of queries is expected. Top query is considered Master Query. All other details to master
#You can NOT have detail of detail
#make sure that column names are unique within ALL queries
#all blob type db columns are treated as images
#for Oracle (notice the Where clause: "trans_cust_code = :cust_code". cust_code is the parameter that will be bound to a value at run time. Different syntax for Oracle and MySQL
#   if cust_code is a column of first query then the value of that column will be used. If not then you will be prompted for a value
Queries:
    - "Select to_char(my_code) cust_code, my_name cust_name, to_char(sysdate,'dd/mm/yyyy') curr_date, to_char(nvl(my_balance,0)) curr_balance, my_signature, (Select my_signature From SIGNATURES Where MY_CODE = 2) pres_sign From SIGNATURES Order By MY_CODE"
    - "Select to_char(trans_date, 'dd/mm/yyyy') trans_date, to_char(trans_debit) trans_debit, to_char(trans_credit) trans_credit, to_char(trans_balance) trans_balance From Transactions Where trans_cust_code = :cust_code Order By trans_date"
    - "Select to_char(toy_code) toy_code, toy_descr, toy_image From TOYS Where toy_cust_code = :cust_code Order By toy_code"
#all blob type db columns are treated as images
#you can also specify width and height of image. If only one is specified (either width or height) the other will be proportionally changed
Images:
    my_signature:
        width: "30"
        height: ""
    pres_sign:
        width: "30"
        height: ""
    toy_image:
        width: ""
        height: "20"
#you can specify in the Params section, command line parameters to be passed
#the order is:
#   if command line arguments are present they will always be used
#   if parameters are present (and no command line arguments) in Params section then they will be used
#   if none of the above then default values will be used
#      to see default values just enter "MyMailMergeV5.py -h" in the command prompt
Params:
    input: "examples\\MyMailMergeV5.docx"
    output: "examples\\MyMailMergeV5_Oracle_Out.docx"
    log: "MyMailMergeV5_Oracle.log"
