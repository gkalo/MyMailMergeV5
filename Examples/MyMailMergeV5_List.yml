#instead of queries you can use lists of dictionaries with key:value pairs as columns of records
#lists make experimenting very easy. No need for databases or excel files
#make sure that column names are unique within ALL queries

#For a column in a list of dictionaries or in a file to be treated as image must be contained in the Images section that follows
#you can also specify width and height of image. If only one is specified (either width or height) the other will be proportionally changed
Images:
    my_signature:
        width: "30"
        height: ""
    pres_sign:
        width: "30"
        height: ""
    toy_image:
        width: ""
        height: "20"
#you can specify in the Params section, command line parameters to be passed
#the order is:
#   if command line arguments are present they will always be used
#   if parameters are present (and no command line arguments) in Params section then they will be used
#   if none of the above then default values will be used
#      to see default values just enter "MyMailMergeV5.py -h" in the command prompt
Params:
    input: "examples\\MyMailMergeV5.docx"
    output: "examples\\MyMailMergeV5_List_Out.docx"
    log: "MyMailMergeV5_List.log"
