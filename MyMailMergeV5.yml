#Mail Connection info. If there is no need to send email do not include this section
#if username is equal to empty string, then it is assumed that no login is required
#if password is not present (but username is) then you will be prompted for one
#if password is present (and username) then it is used (even if its equal to empty string)
#to successfully send mail must include the following into master (first) query:

#Queries info. A list of queries is expected. Top query is considered Master Query. All other details to master
#You can NOT have detail of detail
#every record for first query is stored in rec_mas dictionary. Every record for all other queries are stored in rec_det[n] list of dictionaries. n is from 0 to detail query number
#every query list item can be a string (Query string) or a list of dictionaries with key:value pairs as columns of records or a dictionary defining an Excel or delimited file
#make sure that column names are unique within ALL queries
#all blob type db columns are treated as images
#For a column in a list of dictionaries to be treated as image must also be present in the Images section that follows
Queries:
#If the query is to be used in a table make sure that the first column is used in that table. The first column is always used to initiate the mailmerge

#for Excel or CSV files. If the file is to be used in a table make sure that the first column in the file is used. The first column is always used to initiate the mailmerge
#if you define an Excel file, use file_name for the actual file and the sheet parameter for the sheet inside the file (even if there is only one sheet)
#if you define a delimited file, use only file_name for the actual file. Do NOT use sheet, remove it or leave it blank.
#   You must also provide the delimiter used. if no delimiter is present tab ('\t') is assumed
